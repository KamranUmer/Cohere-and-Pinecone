## Cohere AI's LLM for Semantic Search with Pinecone
Welcome to the GitHub repository for Cohere AI's Large Language Model (LLM) integrated with Semantic Search using Pinecone vector database. This project combines the power of Cohere AI's language understanding capabilities with Pinecone's efficient vector database to create a robust system for semantic search.

# Overview
This project leverages Cohere AI's Large Language Model to understand the semantic context of textual data. It then utilizes Pinecone, a vector database, to efficiently index and retrieve semantically similar documents.

# Features
Semantic Search:
Leverage Cohere AI's LLM to understand the semantic meaning behind text.
Efficient Indexing: Utilize Pinecone's vector database for fast and scalable indexing of textual data.
Vector Similarity Search: Conduct vector similarity searches to find documents with similar semantic meaning

# Usage
The main functionality of this project includes indexing documents and performing semantic searches. 

# Acknowledgments
Cohere AI for providing the Large Language Model.
Pinecone for the powerful vector database.
